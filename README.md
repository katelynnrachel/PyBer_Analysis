# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to act as a data analysis for a ride sharing company and use Matplotlib to create visualizations based on the ride-sharing data by city type. I then used Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

The dataframe above shows us that urban cities had the highest number of rides, drivers, and  total fares. However, rural cities had the highest average fair per ride and the highest average fair per driver. Suburban cities seem to lie in the middle of the data between urban and rural in all ride-sharing data. Overall there is an inverse relationship between the total rides in a city and the average fair per driver, which makes sense given that the less rides there are, the demand and therefore price would go up.

The line chart displays the weekly fair for each city type over the span of four months. Here we can see that urban cities generate the most money each week, followed by suburban then rural cities.



## Summary
Based on these results, here are three recommendations I would make:
1. Rural cities seem to have the least amount of rides, but the highest average fair per driver. By increasing the drivers in rural areas, it can lower the price and therefore incentivize more people to join or utilize the service.
2. There is also potential in suburban areas, where an increase in drivers could help generate a higher total fair.
3. By looking at more monthly data, the company can use trends to find where resources and marketing could be best used, and to figure out when and where there could be an increase in price for rides.
